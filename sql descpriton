Database
- MySQL 8+ recommended. Adjust procedures/triggers syntax for other RDBMS.

Included files
- create_tables.sql — schema, constraints, indexes
- sample_data.sql — sample records to get started
- queries_examples.sql — example queries and a saved view
- stored_procedures.sql — procedures to loan and return books
- trigger_update_copies.sql — trigger to update available copies on insert

How to run
1. Install MySQL or use an online SQL sandbox.
2. Run create_tables.sql to create the database and schema.
3. Run sample_data.sql to populate initial data.
4. Run stored_procedures.sql and trigger_update_copies.sql.
5. Explore queries in queries_examples.sql and try the exercises below.

Suggested milestones (for a 1–2 week learning plan)
- Day 1: Understand the ER design and create tables.
- Day 2: Insert sample data and write basic SELECT/WHERE queries.
- Day 3: Practice JOINs and GROUP BY (reports).
- Day 4: Implement and test stored procedures and transactions.
- Day 5: Add triggers and a view, add indexes, optimize queries.
- Day 6–7: Build a small UI or export reports and prepare a short README and demo.

Exercises / features to implement
- Add reservation table: members can reserve books when no copies available.
- Implement fines calculation policy and monthly fine report.
- Add authentication table for librarians (hash passwords).
- Build a minimal web UI (Flask/Express/Node) to use stored procedures.
- Create unit tests that verify procedures and triggers behave as expected.

Assessment criteria (what to show a recruiter)
- ER diagram and normalization reasoning.
- SQL scripts (clean, commented).
- Demonstration of transactional safety (loan/return).
- Sample queries and reports (top books, active loans, overdue).
- Optional: a short video/screenshots of running the app, or a tiny web frontend.

Notes & tips
- Always use transactions when changing multiple tables (loans + books).
- Use foreign keys and constraints to keep data consistent.
- Use parametrized queries in any app layer to avoid SQL injection.

If you want:
- I can convert these scripts to PostgreSQL.
- I can generate an ER diagram image, step-by-step walkthrough to run locally, or a minimal Flask app that uses this DB.
- I can create a one-page resume-ready project summary and sample demo script.
